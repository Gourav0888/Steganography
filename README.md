# Steganography in C
This project implements Steganography, the technique of hiding data within an image file, using C programming. It allows users to:

- Hide a secret message inside an image (BMP format)
- Extract a hidden message from a BMP image

The project demonstrates how to manipulate image data at the byte level and showcases how information can be embedded into and retrieved 
from image files without significantly altering the visual appearance of the image.
